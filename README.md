EXPLANATION : 
In this task, I build and visualize a Decision Tree using Scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. The goal is to use a dataset of our choice to predict or classify outcomes based on certain input features. This task helps us understand how machines make decisions by learning from data.

Step 1: Import all the Library of Python

Step 2: Load Dataset
 I used Iris dataset which includes features of different types of flowers and their species.
 
Step 3: Prepare the Data
Next, I split the dataset into:
Features (X): The input variables.
Target (y): The label or output we want to predict.
Then, split the data into training and testing sets so the model can learn from one part and be evaluated on another.

Step 4: Build the Decision Tree Model
 Use Scikit-learn’s DecisionTreeClassifier to create our model. The model learns patterns in the training data so it can make predictions.
 
Step 5: Make Predictions
Once the model is trained, I ask it to make predictions on the test set.

Step 6: Evaluate the Model
Then, check how accurate the predictions are using metrics like accuracy score or confusion matrix.

 Step 7: Visualize the Decision Tree
Now comes the most important part — visualizing the decision-making process of the model. This helps us understand how it decides between different classes.

Step 8: Analyze the Results
After visualizing, we analyze:
Which features are most important for classification.
How deep the tree is.
Whether the tree is too complex or overfitting.
